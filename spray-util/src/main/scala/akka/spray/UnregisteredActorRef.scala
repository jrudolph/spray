 * An ActorRef which

 * - is never registered anywhere, i.e. can be GCed as soon the receiver drops it or is GCed itself
 *
 * CAUTION: This ActorRef is _not_ addressable from a non-local JVM and it also breaks some otherwise
 * valid invariants like `system.actorFor(ref.path.toString).equals(ref)` in the local-only context.
 * It should therefore be used only in purely local environments and in consideration of the limitations.
 * You can, however, manually wrap it with a registered ActorRef using one of the register... calls.
