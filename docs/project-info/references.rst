Since its inception in early 2011 organisations around the globe have been running applications using *spray*
successfully in production.

For the ones who'd like to make their using *spray* public we have created this page. If you'd like your organisation
to be listed here (along with a backlink) please provide us with the following details:

- Name of your organisation
- Homepage URL
- Short statement about how *spray* is used and/or your experiences (so far) with it.

`VMware <http://www.vmware.com>`_
  Thanks again for all your hard work on spray. The vCloud Integration Manager wouldn't have shipped (at least on time)
  without it, and we look forward to continuing to use it in our current project as well. :-)

`Ebay <http://www.ebay.com>`_
  We are using spray for an internal project here at ebay. It is quite small, and it was mostly as an excuse to learn
  about actor-based programming, but so far we have been very impressed by *spray's* performance and simplicity and the
  fantastic support on the user group.

`Movio <http://movio.co>`_
  Movio is a big data analytics platform for the cinema industry. We receive all our data through our Restful API,
  powered by *spray*. We have some complex requirements with routing and *spray's* routing module provides the
  flexibility to dynamically manipulate routes. We also use *spray* as the REST backend to our application console which
  is a single page web app. *spray* is an awesome platform = akka + http + performance + simplicity.

`Pongr <http://pongr.com>`_
  At Pongr, spray powers the restful API used by our iPhone & Android apps and has been in production for a few months
  now. We use *spray-routing* on top of *spray-can*, wrapped into one fat jar. We are very happy with *spray*.

`yardi.com <http://www.yardi.com>`_
  We're using *spray* for a sizeable set of REST web services for our real-estate platform. Some of the services are a
  REST-based event bus, a notification/email system, a rights-management system (kind of like an authority/security
  system), and many others. We're getting excellent use out of *spray*, and want to pass on our thanks again for all
  the work!

`Metafor Software <http://metaforsoftware.com/>`_
  We just went live with *spray* in production for the REST backend of our "single-page" web app a couple weeks ago.
  Very low volume, since we're still in semi-private beta, but I'm very happy with it so far.
  The immutable request/response model is a huge win for clarity and composability.

`TimeTrade <http://www.timetrade.com>`_
  TimeTrade has used *spray* to build a number of core services within our online appointment scheduling system,
  and we plan to use it for even more. It also forms the basis of our stress testing framework.
  We've found it to be of excellent quality, and it represents the immutable model of HTTP in a very elegant way.
  The team behind it is very responsive and helpful.

`nokta <http://nokta.com>`_
  We are running *spray* in front of our ad-server at nokta.com, hosting ads for several high-volume websites
  (millions of visitors everyday). 3 servers are deployed with custom tarball with dependencies copied in it, and are
  running with custom init-scripts. We've started with play2 but switched to *spray* in the first week of production
  and never looked back. Besides technical merits the active community is what makes this project awesome.

`Tinga <http://www.tingatech.com>`_
  We decided to use *spray* + Akka instead of using Play + Akka, as we'd like to have a clear separation between the
  API- and presentation layers. We are still in the earlier stage of building our infrastructure but are impressed
  by the community and the *spray* team's responsiveness.

`telfish.com <http://www.telfish.com>`_
  We are using *spray-can*, *spray-server* and *spray-json* for our customer-facing query API for more than a year now
  and are very happy with it. Our API code is robust, fast and easy to maintain.

`Zuberance <http://www.zuberance.com>`_
  We developed a new product completely on top of Scala/Akka/spray and are just finishing up beta.

`system insights <http://systeminsights.com>`_
  We converted from Jersey, which took about 2 weeks. The testability of *spray* is great -- and runs fast.
