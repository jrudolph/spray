/**
 * A ByteBuffer pool reduces the number of ByteBuffer allocations in the SslTlsSupport.
 * The reason why SslTlsSupport requires a buffer pool is because the
 * current SSLEngine implementation always requires a 17KiB buffer for
 * every 'wrap' and 'unwrap' operation.  In most cases, the actual size of the
 * required buffer is much smaller than that, and therefore allocating a 17KiB
 * buffer for every 'wrap' and 'unwrap' operation wastes a lot of memory
 * bandwidth, resulting in application performance degradation.
 *
 * This implementation is very loosely based on the one from Netty.
